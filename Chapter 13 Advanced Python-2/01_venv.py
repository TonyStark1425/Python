# An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated 
# from the other Python environments on the system.

# To use virtual environments, we write:
# pip install virtualenv # Install the package
# We create a new environment using:
# virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv
# The next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it.
# We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python installation.
