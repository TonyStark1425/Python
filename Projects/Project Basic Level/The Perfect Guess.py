# # We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks 
# # the user to guess it.
# # If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program 
# # 'displays "Lower number please". Similarly, if the user's guess is too 
# # low, the program prints "higher number please" When the user guesses 
# # the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the 
# # player used to arrive at the number.
# # Hint: Use the random module.
